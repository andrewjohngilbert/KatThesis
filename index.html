                  <strong>TL;DR:</strong>
                  This PhD thesis investigates how audiences evaluate trust, credibility, emotion, and ethical acceptability in nonfiction films when traditional indexical imagery is contrasted with AI-generated synthetic visuals. It introduces the concept of <em>Inference Journalism</em> as a transparent genre label for AI-based reconstruction in nonfiction media.

    <p>
      This thesis examines how audiences evaluate trust, credibility, emotions, and ethical acceptability in nonfiction
      films when comparing traditional indexical imagery with AI-generated synthetic visuals. The implicit contract of
      nonfiction, that what is shown has an indexical link to reality, is increasingly unsettled by AI. As synthetic media
      enters documentary and journalism, a pressing question arises: how do audiences evaluate trust and authenticity when
      the anchor of recording is replaced by machine inference?
    </p>
    <p>
      Two short films were produced for the study: a real documentary constructed from conventional footage and a synthetic
      version generated using machine learning models. Participants did not know whether the film they viewed was real or
      synthetic, ensuring that their responses were shaped by the viewing experience itself rather than by disclosure.
      A mixed-methods design was employed. Quantitative survey data were analysed in Survey Monkey and Excel, while
      qualitative open-text responses were coded and thematically analysed in NVivo. The analysis was organised into six
      thematic areas: educational value and perceived reliability; emotional response and empathy; perception of ethical
      boundaries; realism and visual impact; trust and credibility; and viewer awareness and interpretive frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Findings highlight three overarching contributions. First, indexical anchors remain central to trust: technical flaws
      in the real film were tolerated as signs of authenticity, whereas anomalies in the synthetic film were interpreted as
      evidence of unreality. Second, in the AI-generated film, two deliberately designed reconstructions of a deceased
      individual produced heightened emotional closeness while also provoking strong ethical discomfort, a tension
      conceptualised here as the empathy–ethics paradox and one of the study’s most significant findings. Third, ethical
      boundaries were drawn more firmly around people than places: while AI use to recreate environments was broadly
      accepted if transparent, recreating deceased individuals was largely rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building on these insights, the study proposes Inference Journalism as a new professional genre term for nonfiction
      storytelling. Defined as the transparent use of AI/ML to infer and reconstruct places, events, or people from
      real-world anchors such as photographs, recordings, or data traces, Inference Journalism frames synthetic material as
      reconstruction rather than deception. By offering audiences a clear interpretive category, this genre proposal seeks
      to stabilise expectations and support ethical, accountable uses of AI in nonfiction media.
